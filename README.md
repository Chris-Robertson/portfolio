# Chris Robertson - Developer Portfolio Website

https://chris-robertson.github.io/portfolio/

## Brief
This portfolio website was made as our first major project when I was studying at CoderFactory Academy coding bootcamp. The brief was to simply create a website that could be shown to prospective employers in the future. It should showcase any projects that I have created, as well as contain an about bio and ways to contact me.

## Restrictions
I restricted myself to only using plain HTML and CSS. While I am aware that there are many, many frameworks, boilerplates and languages that can be used to make website development easier and more powerfull, I wanted to restrict myself to only the basics. My reasoning was that I would better understand the use of these framworks if I had a fuller idea of the underlaying technology that they are augmenting.

## Inspiration
At the time I was listening to a lot of 80s-style retro synthwave music and was heavily inspired by the neon-infused gaudy style of the era.

I collected inspirational images into a board on [niice.co](https://niice.co/m/4dbeb203f69cb87f0b3b8c04d6e8d6d7)
From these images I created an idea for the theme and colour palette I would aim for.
