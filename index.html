                <p>I am an aspiring software developer currently studying at a coding bootcamp. I have moved into the industry a little bit later in life and I bring with me a wealth of worldly experience and a life-long addiction to learning. This gives me the skills to communicate and relate with people across backgrounds, positions and frames of reference.</p>  
                
                <p>I have found immense enjoyment and satisfaction in mucking around with programming since I taught myself GW-BASIC on the family Amstrad PC-20. I have used this penchant for problem-solving to be successful in many roles, but have realised that it was all brewing up to culminate in a career in software.</p>
                
                <p>I'm excited by the prospect of using my passion for back-end technologies and programming languages to solve meaningful problems that impact people all over the world.
