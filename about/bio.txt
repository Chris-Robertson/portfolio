I am an aspiring software developer. Despite moving seriously into the industry a little bit later in life, I bring with me a wealth of worldly experience and a life-long addiction to learning. This gives me skills to communicate with people across backgrounds, positions and frames of reference.

I have found immense enjoyment and satisfaction in mucking around with programming ever since I taught myself GW-BASIC on the family Amstrad PC-20. I have used this penchant for problem-solving to be successful in many roles, but have realised that it was all brewing up to culminate in a career in development.

I'm excited by the prospect of using my passion for back-end technologies and programming languages to solve meaningful problems that impact people all over the world.
